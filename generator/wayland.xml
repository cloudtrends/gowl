  <Interface name="wl_registry" version="1">
    <Description summary="global registry object">
      The global registry object.  The server has a number of global
      objects that are available to all clients.  These objects
      typically represent an actual object in the server (for example,
      an input device) or they are singleton objects that provides
      extension functionality.

      When a client creates a registry object, the registry object
      will emit a global event for each global currently in the
      registry.  Globals come and go as a result of device hotplugs,
      reconfiguration or other events, and the registry will send out
      @global and @global_remove events to keep the client up to date
      with the changes.  To mark the end of the initial burst of
      events, the client can use the wl_display.sync request
      immediately after calling wl_display.get_registry.

      A client can 'bind' to a global object by using the bind
      request.  This creates a client side handle that lets the object
      emit events to the client and lets the client invoke requests on
      the object.

        "default" The client has no preference on fullscreen behavior,

        "driver" The client wants to switch video mode to the smallest mode
        that can fit the client buffer. If the sizes do not match the

        "fill" The surface is centered on the output on the screen with no

        add black borders.

	Set the contents of a buffer into this surface. The x and y

	other words, the x and y, and the width and height of the wl_buffer
	together define in which directions the surface's size changes.

	Surface contents are double-buffered state, see wl_surface.commit.

	The initial surface contents are void; there is no content.
	wl_surface.attach assigns the given wl_buffer as the pending wl_buffer.
	wl_surface.commit applies the pending wl_buffer as the new
	surface contents, and the size of the surface becomes the size of
	the wl_buffer. The wl_buffer is also kept as pending, until
	changed by wl_surface.attach or the wl_buffer is destroyed.

	Committing a pending wl_buffer allows the compositor to read the
	pixels in the wl_buffer. The compositor may access the pixels at any
	time after the wl_surface.commit request. When the compositor will
	not access the pixels anymore, it will send the wl_buffer.release
	event. Only after receiving wl_buffer.release, the client may re-use
	the wl_buffer. A wl_buffer, that has been attached and then replaced
	by another attach instead of committed, will not receive a release
	event, and is not used by the compositor.

	Destroying the wl_buffer after wl_buffer.release does not change the
	surface contents, even if the wl_buffer is still pending for the
	next commit. In such case, the next commit does not change the
	surface contents. However, if the client destroys the wl_buffer
	before receiving wl_buffer.release, the surface contents become
	undefined immediately.

	On commit, a pending wl_buffer is applied first, all other state
